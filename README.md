Description: Using the HTML & CSS skills I have developed, I will deconstruct & then reconstruct the Google homepage.

Plan: 
-establish the main elements
    -main "Google" image
    -search form
-get them to display center & horizontal 
-create a nav bar across the top 
    -correctly position elements
-create a footer 

* New Things Learned *
-media queries: @media; define different style rules for different media types
    Ex: have one set of style rules for computers, one for printers, one for mobile devices, etc
